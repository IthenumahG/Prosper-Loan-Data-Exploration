# Prosper Loan Data Exploration 

## by Gideon Ithenumah


## Dataset

This analysis explores a dataset that contains loan information of 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. For the purpose of this analysis I will narrow down the dataset to few variables of interest for my analysis. The dataset was provided by udacity.  

## Summary of Findings  

Below are key findings from my analysis of the dataset;

* Most loans are given to employed individuals with a total of 59%, which is higher than other categories put together. This makes sense because they stand a better chance of repayment.  
* Asides the borrowers whose occupation was not specified, it is seen that Professionals take the most loans.  
* Califonia, CA, has the highest number of borrowers.  
* People with yearly income range between $25,000 and $49,999 take out loans the most.  
* Majority of the loans are current.  
* Most loans are taken to consolidate (pay off) other loans.  
* LoanOriginalAmount and MonthlyLoanPayment have a strong positive relationship.  
* ProsperScore and BorrowerAPR have a negative relationship'  
* LoanOriginalAmount and ProsperScore have positive relationship.  
* LoanOriginalAmount and BorrowerAPR have a negative relationship.  
* StatedMonthlyIncome and LoanOriginalAmount have apositive relationship.
* For each category of loan status, the lowest APR is for Employed and and borrowers wit Full-time jobs, whereas highest APR is for Not employed.


## Key Insights for Presentation 

For the presentation, I focus on the journey of exploring the features of interest to discover the relationship between the borrowers and the loans they took. I introduced the features of interest, followed by how they relate to one another and eventually how their correlation is affected by another variable. Features include: Borrowers' employment status, their income range, stated monthly income and the loan original amount.
